    // Let's say we have an array

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    console.log(players, team);
    
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team[3] = "Lux"
    
    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(players, team);

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[3] = "Lux2"
    console.log(team2, players);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[3] = "Lux3"
    console.log(team3, players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [].concat(...players);
    team4[3] = "Lux4"
    console.log(team4, players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const people = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 60 });

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    console.log(person, people);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
