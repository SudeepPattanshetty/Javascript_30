# 🔁 JavaScript: Reference vs Copy (JS30 - Day 14)

This project demonstrates the primitives, references types in Javascript



## ✨ Features

* Demonstrates the difference between primitive and reference types in JavaScript.

* Shows how modifying arrays or objects via references affects the original.

* Explains and implements different methods for copying:

    * Arrays: .slice(), .concat(), spread operator (...)

    * Objects: Object.assign(), spread operator, deep copy via JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())

* Highlights the limitation of shallow copies.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* HTML5

* Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

* Console for output logging

## 📚 What I Learned

* The difference between copying by value (primitives) and copying by reference (arrays and objects).

* Multiple methods to perform shallow copies in JavaScript.

* Limitations of shallow copies when dealing with nested structures.

* How to perform a deep clone using JSON methods, and why it's not always ideal.
