# 🔍 Type Ahead (Live Search) – (JS30 Day 6)

This project implements a live "type-ahead" search feature that dynamically filters and displays U.S. cities and states as the user types. Built as part of the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) challenge by Wes Bos.



## 🔥Features

* Live search and filtering of over 1,000 U.S. cities and states.

* Highlights matching text in results.

* Displays city, state, and formatted population count.

* Interactive UI with smooth styling and perspective effects.



## 🚀Technologies Used

* HTML

* CSS

* JavaScript (Vanilla)

* Fetch API



## 🧠What I Learned 

* How to declare and use CSS variables (`--custom-prop`) with the `:root` selector.

* Linking input elements to CSS styles through JavaScript.

* Using the `dataset` attribute to manage dynamic units like `px`.

* Handling real-time events with `mousemove` and `change` to create a responsive UI.

* Strengthened understanding of how JavaScript can bridge user interactions and styling without page reloads.
